/**
 * @title Redistribution contract
 * @author The Swarm Authors
 * @dev Implements a Schelling Co-ordination game to form consensus around the Reserve Commitment hash. This takes
 * place in three phases: _commit_, _reveal_ and _claim_.
 *
 * A node, upon establishing that it _isParticipatingInUpcomingRound_, i.e. it's overlay falls within proximity order
 * of its reported depth with the _currentRoundAnchor_, prepares a "reserve commitment hash" using the chunks
 * it currently stores in its reserve and calculates the "storage depth" (see Bee for details). These values, if calculated
 * honestly, and with the right chunks stored, should be the same for every node in a neighbourhood. This is the Schelling point.
 * Each eligible node can then use these values, together with a random, single use, secret  _revealNonce_ and their
 * _overlay_ as the pre-image values for the obsfucated _commit_, using the _wrapCommit_ method.
 *
 * Once the _commit_ round has elapsed, participating nodes must provide the values used to calculate their obsfucated
 * _commit_ hash, which, once verified for correctness and proximity to the anchor are retained in the _currentReveals_.
 * Nodes that have commited but do not reveal the correct values used to create the pre-image will have their stake
 * "frozen" for a period of rounds proportional to their reported depth.
 *
 * During the _reveal_ round, randomness is updated after every successful reveal. Once the reveal round is concluded,
 * the _currentRoundAnchor_ is updated and users can determine if they will be eligible their overlay will be eligible
 * for the next commit phase using _isParticipatingInUpcomingRound_.
 *
 * When the _reveal_ phase has been concluded, the claim phase can begin. At this point, the truth teller and winner
 * are already determined. By calling _isWinner_, an applicant node can run the relevant logic to determine if they have
 * been selected as the beneficiary of this round. When calling _claim_, the current pot from the PostageStamp contract
 * is withdrawn and transferred to that beneficiaries address. Nodes that have revealed values that differ from the truth,
 * have their stakes "frozen" for a period of rounds proportional to their reported depth.
