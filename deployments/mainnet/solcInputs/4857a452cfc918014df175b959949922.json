This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

During the _expiry_ process, each of these balances is\n * checked against the _currentTotalOutPayment_, a similarly normalised figure that represents the current cost of\n * storing one chunk since the beginning of time. A batch with a normalised balance less than _currentTotalOutPayment_\n * is treated as expired.\n *\n * The _currentTotalOutPayment_ is calculated using _totalOutPayment_ which is updated during _setPrice_ events so\n * that the applicable per-chunk prices can be charged for the relevant periods of time. This can then be multiplied\n * by the amount of chunks which are allowed to be stamped by each batch to get the actual cost of storage.\n *\n * The amount of chunks a batch can stamp is determined by the _bucketDepth_. A batch may store a maximum of 2^depth chunks.\n * The global figure for the currently allowed chunks is tracked by _validChunkCount_ and updated during batch _expiry_ events.\n */\n\ncontract

This takes\n * place in three phases: _commit_, _reveal_ and _claim_.\n *\n * A node, upon establishing that it _isParticipatingInUpcomingRound_, i.e. it's overlay falls within proximity order\n * of its reported depth with the _currentRoundAnchor_, prepares a \"reserve commitment hash\" using the chunks\n * it currently stores in its reserve and calculates the \"storage depth\" (see Bee for details). These values, if calculated\n * honestly, and with the right chunks stored, should be the same for every node in a neighbourhood. This is the Schelling point.\n * Each eligible node can then use these values, together with a random, single use, secret  _revealNonce_ and their\n * _overlay_ as the pre-image values for the obsfucated _commit_, using the _wrapCommit_ method.\n *\n * Once the _commit_ round has elapsed, participating nodes must provide the values used to calculate their obsfucated\n * _commit_ hash, which, once verified for correctness and proximity to the anchor are retained in the _currentReveals_.\n * Nodes that have committed but do not reveal the correct values used to create the pre-image will have their stake\n * \"frozen\" for a period of rounds proportional to their reported depth.\n *\n * During the _reveal_ round, randomness is updated after every successful reveal. Once the reveal round is concluded,\n * the _currentRoundAnchor_ is updated and users can determine if they will be eligible their overlay will be eligible\n * for the next commit phase using _isParticipatingInUpcomingRound_.\n *\n * When the _reveal_ phase has been concluded, the claim phase can begin. At this point, the truth teller and winner\n * are already determined. By calling _isWinner_, an applicant node can run the relevant logic to determine if they have\n * been selected as the beneficiary of this round. When calling _claim_, the current pot from the PostageStamp contract\n * is withdrawn and transferred to that beneficiaries address. Nodes that have revealed values that differ from the truth,\n * have their stakes \"frozen\" for a period of rounds proportional to their reported depth.\n */\n\ncontract Redistribution is AccessControl, Pausable {\n    // ----------------------------- Type declarations ------------------------------\n\n    // An eligible user may commit to an _obfuscatedHash_ during the commit phase...\n    struct Commit {\n        bytes32 overlay;\n        address owner;\n        bool revealed;\n        uint8 height;\n        uint256 stake;\n        bytes32 obfuscatedHash;\n        uint256 revealIndex;\n    }\n    // ...then provide the actual values that are the constituents of the pre-image of the _obfuscatedHash_\n    // during the reveal phase.\n    struct Reveal {\n        bytes32 overlay;\n        address owner;\n        uint8 depth;\n        uint256 stake;\n        uint256 stakeDensity;\n        bytes32 hash;\n    }\n\n    struct ChunkInclusionProof {\n        bytes32[] proofSegments;\n        bytes32 proveSegment;\n        // _RCspan is known for RC 32*32\n\n        // Inclusion proof of transformed address\n        bytes32[] proofSegments2;\n        bytes32 proveSegment2;\n        // proveSegmentIndex2 known from deterministic random selection;\n        uint64 chunkSpan;\n        bytes32[] proofSegments3;\n        //  _proveSegment3 known, is equal _proveSegment2\n        // proveSegmentIndex3 know, is equal _proveSegmentIndex2;\n        // chunkSpan2 is equal to chunkSpan (as the data is the same)\n        //\n        PostageProof postageProof;\n        SOCProof[] socProof;\n    }\n\n    struct SOCProof {\n        address signer;
