# Swarm Storage Incentives

This repository contains the smart contracts for Swarm's storage incentives.

# Overview

In order to distribute to upload content to the Swarm network, _batches_ of _postage stamps_ are purchased by nodes. These _stamps_ are then attached to content that is divided into 4kb chunks and then uploaded to the Swarm network. In order to distribute the proceeds from the sales of these _batches_, a [Schelling Co-ordination Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game) is implemented using the smart contracts contained in this repository, in order to identify nodes storing the canonical subset of valid chunks that fall within the radius of resposibility of each node in a _neighbourhood_ at the time of their application. Correct identification of this hash qualifies a node to apply to receive a reward comprising value arising from _expired_ _batches_.

# Stakes

Each _storage node_ seeking to benefit from _storage incentive_ rewards should stake at least the _minimum stake_ by sending _BZZ_ to the [staking contract](src/Staking.sol). This stake permits each node to particpate in the Schelling game. At this stage, to keep things simple, a stake is not withdrawable. It is expected over time that neighbourhood stakes will find a homeostasis at an amount proportional to a node's expected future returns minus their running costs.

For each _round_ of the _storage rewards redistribution_ process, a node is chosen at random from the participants proportional to their _stake density_ to be that round's _truth teller_. Nodes that agree with this _"truth"_ are qualified to receive the entire reward for that _round_ if they are chosen by a second random selection procedure, wherein the probability of their selection is similarly weighted by the _density_ of their stake. Over time, all else being equal, a node will hence receive reward relative to the proportional size of their stake if they are fully participant in the Swarm protocols.

A node must have _staked_ at least two _rounds_ prior to their application. If a _stake_ is updated, a node may not participate until the next two _rounds_ have elapsed.

# Current Implementation (Phase 3)

Every _N_ blocks, at the end of the previous _reveal phase_, the [redistribution contract](src/Staking.sol) selects a random _round anchor_ which determines which _neighbourhood_ may participate in the current _round_. Eligibility is determined by calculating the proximity of a node's _overlay address_ to the _round anchor_. A node is eligible if their proximity order to the anchor is less than or equal to the canonical _storage depth_ that they use to calculate their _commit hash_.

If eligible to participate, a node will use the chunks in its _reserve_ to calculate a _reserve commitment_. This is the _keccack256_ hash of a the first _m_ chunk addresses when transformed using the standard _hmac_ keyed hash function where the _round anchor_ is used as the key. The _reserve commitment_ should be the same for each node in a neighbourhood and represents their ability to access a full canonical reserve of chunks at the time that the _anchor_ was selected. The nodes then combine this with a unique _reveal nonce_, their _overlay_ and their current _storage depth_, defined as the maximum _proximity order_ between their _address_ and that of the furthest chunk that still falls within the node's fixed size _reserve_. The _keccack256_ hash of the concatentation of these values is known as a _commit hash_. This is then submitted to the blockchain during that _round's_ _commit_ phase.

If nodes in the neighbourhood's _pull sync_ protocols are running as they should, each node in the neighbourhood will calculate the same _reserve commitment hash_ and _storage depth_. However, since the _commit hash_ calculation also includes a random _reveal nonce_ in before it is hashed, each node's _reserve commitment hash_ and _storage depth_ is kept private during the _commit phase_. Once the _commit phase_ is over, the _reveal phase_ begins, and each participating node is expected to send another transaction to the _redistribution contract_ with the corresponding pre-image of the hash, comprising the _reserve commitment_, _storage depth_ and _reveal nonce_.

If the revealed _reserve commitment_, _storage depth_ and _reveal nonce_ values are found to correctly re-hash to the _commit hash_ the node has submitted, the node is included in a procedure to select the node that will be the beneficiary of the rewards from this round. If the reveal values do not has to the submitted pre-image, the node's overlay is _frozen_ for a number of rounds proportional to the reported _storage depth_, and that overlay is prevented from being able to participate until this period has elapsed.

Once the _reveal phase_ is over, the _claim phase_ begins. A random _seed_ is chosen using the _block.difficulty_ (= _block.prevrandao_ in post-merge chains) as a source of randomness. Based on this, a node is selected as the _truth teller_ for this round, with a probability proportional to its _stake density_, then, from the nodes that agree with this _"truth"_, a beneficiary of this round's rewards is selected, with a probability similarly proportional to its _stake density_.

The entire amount of the total of the _postage batch_ proceeds that have _expired_ during this round are _withdrawn_ from the [postage stamp contract](src/Postage.sol) and transferred to the _winner_. Nodes that have revealed _reserve commitments_ or _storage depths_ that do not agree with the _truth teller_ are _frozen_ for a period longer but similarly proportioned to the truthy depth and will have to wait until _unfrozen_ to participate again.

When the claim is submitted, the cardinality of the truthy set of applicants is used as to provide a signal to change the price of storage. If the redundancy per neighbourhood is at the desired amount (4), no action is taken and the price remains static. If it is lower, this indicates an overdemand for storage and an undersupply of storage nodes - the price per chunk per block is increased to cause batches to expire more quickly and to attract more storage nodes to the network. Conversely, if more than 4 nodes per neighbourhood apply with a truthy _reserve commitment_, this indicates an oversupply of storage nodes and the price is decreased to ensure the efficiency of service provision.

As the _seed_ is chosen, the _anchor_ for the next round is revealed. Once it has noticed it is within the _neighbourhood_, a node may begin calculating its
_reserve commitment_ in preparation for the upcoming _commit phase_, and so the cycle repeats.
